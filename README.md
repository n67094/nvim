# NEOVIM LUA CONFIG

## Dependencies

Those deps should be installed:

- packer
- universal-ctags
- ripgrep
- nnn (filebrowser)

## Setup

Once deps are installed you can install plugins via:

```
:PackerInstall
```

Followed by:

```
:PackerCompile
```

Once you restart nvim it should ask you to run few commands, that I encourage you to do.
